        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These baked scrambled eggs are light and fluffy and are
            a snap to put together for a big crowd. I usually make
            two pans for our Christmas brunch, and I never have
            many leftovers!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup butter or margarine, melted</li>
            <li>24 eggs</li>
            <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>2 and 1/2 cups milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Pout melted butter into a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.</li>
            <li>
                Whis together eggs and salt in large bowl until well-blended
                . Gradually whisk in milk. Pour egg mixture into the buttered
                dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Stir egg
                mixture and continue to bake until eggs are set, 10 to 15 minutes more.
